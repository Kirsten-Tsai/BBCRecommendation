# BBCRecommendation

##Project Introduction

The ultimate goal is to learn how to make a simple article recommendation engine using a semi-recent advance in natural language processing called word2vec (or just word vectors). In particular, we're going to use a "database" from Stanford's GloVe project trained on a dump of Wikipedia. The project involves reading in a database of word vectors and a corpus of text articles then organizing them into a handy table (list of lists) for processing.

To make it user-friendlt, I build a web server that displays a list of BBC articles. Once we click on an article title, it will direct us to the recommended articles that are similar on the contents.
